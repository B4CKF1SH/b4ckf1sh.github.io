									<h1>How to build mechs</h1>
									<p>Personally one of my favorite parts about this game, building mechs. But how do you build a proper mech?</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/mechlab.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<h2>Weapons</h2>
								<p>Arguably the most important things to put on a mech. Afterall, killing things is almost always a sure way to win a game. But how do you pick the right weapons for a mech?</p>
								<h3>The main characteristics of weapons and why they matter</h3>
								<dl>
									<dt>Velocity</dt>
									<dd>
										<p>We want our projectiles to all land at the same place. A good example for why this is important would be a ERLL + ERPPC build. Using that you’ll have to aim both weapons separately which increases exposure time and decreases your accuracy.</p>
									</dd>
									<dt>Range</dt>
									<dd>
										<p>This is simply how far we can shoot. It is important to have this in mind as most builds will want to specialize at one range-bracket only (for reasons I will explain soon).</p>
									</dd>
									<dt>Burn / Burst time</dt>
									<dd>
										<p>This is the time it’ll take you until you are able to twist again. It is also why you may want to put C-ERPPCs on a brawler, even though LPLs would be better in all other stats. LPLs would prevent you from twisting too much.</p>
									</dd>
									<dt>Spread</dt>
									<dd>
										<p>Some roles will require pinpoint weapons such as PPCs or Gauss, others can use LBXs or SRMs. Usually pinpoint is preferred, since it is way more effective.</p>
									</dd>
								</dl>
								<h3>How to combine weapons</h3>
								<p>Let’s face it: A mech with one weapon only is quite weak. And if we only stack weapons of one type, at some point we may be limited - for example by ghost heat. Therefore a lot of the best builds use combinations of weapons.</p>
								<p>To properly pair weapons, we need to look at the aforementioned characteristics. <br><b>Generally we want to combine weapons that are as similar as possible, and then play the mech to the strengths of its weapons, instead of being “prepared” for everything.</b></p>
								<p>So, for example, let’s look at the <i>HBK-IIC-A.</i> Eight nicely placed energy hardpoints on a 50-tonner. Since this mech will be quite tonnage-limited, I’d choose <i>ERML</i>s as our primary weapon. They deal very good damage for their weight and are a pretty good option for medium/heavy laser vomit mechs.</p>
								<p>We can only put 6 of these without ghost heat though and on top of that, 8 would leave us with a lot of tonnage. So, we need to look at other weapons we can add.</p>
								<p>The most important characteristic here is the velocity. We want to pick other lasers, so that we can easily aim. The next-most important one is range, since we want to peak at mid-range. There are no lasers with spread, so that is irrelevant, and burn time is already quite high with <i>ERML</i>s, so even <i>HLL</i>s would be fine.</p>
								<p>And now we have our options: Lasers with as much or more range than <i>ERML</i>s, which also of course can’t cause ghost heat with <i>ERML</i>s. That leaves the <i>ERLL</i>, <i>LPL</i> and the <i>HLL</i>. And guess what? All of them are good options for this build (<i>HLL</i> not so much at a high level of play, since it does have a lot more burn time, but for Quick Play it is definitely fine).</p>

								<h2>Mechs</h2>
								Mechs generally have 3 main things to consider:
								<ul>
									<li>Quirks</li>
									<li>Hardpoints & hardpoint locations</li>
									<li>Hitboxes</li>
								</ul>
								<p></p><i>(Another thing I really look for on mechs are jump-jets, even one gives you a ton of potential for shielding)</i></p>

								<p>As for quirks, you just generally want as many of them as you can get (Of course of the ones that actually apply to your loadout & playstyle).</p>
								<p>Hardpoints and hardpoint locations matter at least as much though, I’d even argue they are way more important. As for the number of hardpoints, you want to be able to fit an optimal weapon combination, that’s all there is. Their location is what really sets mechs apart. You want your weapons as close as possible together both vertically and horizontally, and as close to your cockpit as possible. This is because you want to expose as little of your mech as possible when shooting.</p>

								<h3>Examples for good hardpoint placement:</h3>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/goodmounts.png" alt="" /></div>

								<h3>Examples for bad hardpoint placement:</h3>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/badmounts.png" alt="" /></div>

								<p>Hitboxes are very hard to explain, but they are the main thing determining your mech’s survivability. An excellent mech is the ANH, on which it is pretty hard to isolate components. A bad one would be for example a fafnir. Basically, if you are getting straight CT’d in a mech while you usually don’t in others, it probably has bad hitboxes.</p>
								<p>Keep in mind there is a lot more to mechbuilding, this is only meant to cover the basics. If you need advice, feel free to hit up
